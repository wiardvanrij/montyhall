# Monty hall simulation

This is just a very simple (and perhaps poorly) implementation of the Monty hall problem  written in Go. 


```
➜  montyhall go run main.go
Runs: 10000000
Wins with the first pick only: 3333955 ( 33.34 % )
Wins with the second pick: 6668719 ( 66.69 % )
```

```
➜  montyhall go run main.go
Runs: 10000000
Wins with the first pick only: 3333000 ( 33.33 % )
Wins with the second pick: 6667625 ( 66.68 % )
```
